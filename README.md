# Detection-to-Intervention-Comparative-Analysis-of-Text-Classification-Models-for-Suicide-Prevention

A comparative analysis of text classification models to detect suicidal intent in social media content, enabling timely mental health interventions.  

## **Key Features:**  
- **Models Evaluated:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN.  
- **Dataset:** Curated from social media posts & mental health forums, labeled as "suicide" or "non-suicide."  
- **Preprocessing:** TF-IDF, Bag of Words (BoW), N-gram techniques for text vectorization.  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.  

## **Results:**  
- üèÜ **Top Performers:** Logistic Regression & SVM achieved **92% accuracy** (TF-IDF).  
- üìâ **Weakest Model:** KNN struggled with recall (5% using TF-IDF).  
- üìä **Best Preprocessing:** TF-IDF outperformed BoW and N-gram.  

## **Research Implications:**  
- Highlights the potential of classical ML models in suicide prevention.  
- Identifies gaps: Dataset limited to English, scope for deep learning (e.g., BERT, RNN).
